## Support

Tested on: Winamp 5.7/5.666
WACUP might have problems on it due to its skin engine. If it works properly, then you are lucky. If not, :/
## Installing the skin:
- On the repo, press code -> Download ZIP
- Create a folder called "Big Bento Redux" on ``<your winamp installation directory>\Skins`` and extract the contents of the folder into the folder
- Run Winamp or WACUP and select the skin.
- Enjoy!
## Compiling the scripts (maki)

### "Traditional" Way:

Compile the scripts 1 by 1 using the following command ``.\mc.exe <script name>``

Therefore, it's recommended to compile them with [Vichtor's Winamp Compiler](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rejKyZkHaDyFJh-iARvx_QIFQkzMbqO8/view) 
### Recommended Way (Vichtor's Winamp Compiler):
Place ALL the .m files on the folder and run the file ``buildall.bat``/
