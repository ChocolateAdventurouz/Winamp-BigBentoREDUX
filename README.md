## Compiling the scripts (maki)

### "Traditional" Way:

Compile the scripts 1 by 1 using the following command ``.\mc.exe <script name>``

Therefore, it's recommended to compile them with [Vichtor's Winamp Compiler](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rejKyZkHaDyFJh-iARvx_QIFQkzMbqO8/view) 
### Recommended Way (Vichtor's Winamp Compiler):
Place ALL the .m files on the folder and run the file ``buildall.bat``/
